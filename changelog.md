###CHANGELOG - 10 February 2019

A bug in the phylotree build 17 tree parsing has been fixed, causing replacement of `haplogroups.txt` and `phylotree_r17.pickle` files. The bug was causing wrong predictions mostly for X haplogroups. Please update your MToolBox installation with `git pull`.

###CHANGELOG - 24 Januray 2019

A bug reported in github issues #64 and #56 has been fixed. The bug was affecting the parsing of insertions/deletions performed by the `mtVariantCaller.py` script.

###CHANGELOG - 2 October 2018

A bug in the `MToolBox.sh` script has been identified and fixed. The pipeline was failing  when input folders with "." in the filename were used, pointing at incorrect input directory path.

###CHANGELOG - 8 April 2018

Update to MToolBox v.1.1

1) Sitevar nucleotide variability reported in the `annotation.csv` file has been updated based on 30,806 healthy complete genomes stored in HmtDB database. 

Values of nucleotide variability might have slightly changed for each mt position. Positions with biggest changes compared
to the previous sitevar calculation are:

3328    
10956    
14598    
16135    

Please note that sorting order of variant alleles in the `annotation.csv` can slightly change based on this nucleotide variability update.

2) `vcf_name` is a new option now supported by MToolBox that can be specified in the configuration to assign a name to the VCF file generated by the pipeline. If not specified, `unknown_sample_name.vcf` filename will be created instead.

###CHANGELOG - 11 December 2016

Upload of new files used by GATK IndelsRealigner based on rCRS, with changes in reference name. `chrRCRS` was changed into `chrM` for all the following files in the MToolBox/data directory:

```
- MITOMAP_HMTDB_known_indels_chrM.vcf
- chrM.fa
- chrM.fa.fai
- chrM.dict
- intervals_file_chrM.list
```

`GenomeAnalysisTK.jar` was removed from the `MToolBox/ext_tools` directory as it was an outdated version of the tool.
Users that would like to run GATK IndelRealigner are now asked to download a newer version of GATK and place it in the `MToolBox/ext_tools` folder:

`cp GenomeAnalysisTK.jar /path/to/MToolBox/MToolBox/ext_tools/`

To run GATK IndelRealigner users have to specify `UseIndelRealigner=true` in the config.sh file used to run MToolBox.

###CHANGELOG - 3 June 2016

Update to **MToolBox v.1.0**. The full installation of the pipeline is now possible by running the `install.sh` script provided here: https://github.com/mitoNGS/MToolBox/blob/MToolBox_devel/install.sh. This script will install all the MToolBox dependancies and creates a `setup.sh` file in the MToolBox directory with all the paths to executables and GSNAP databases and references needed by MToolBox, that is sourced by the `MToolBox.sh` file. The users are just asked to fill in the config.sh file, which is the only mandatory argument required by `MToolBox.sh`. The users must assign a value to the mandatory options in the config.sh file and, optionally, they can change other MToolBox arguments. For the full list of MToolBox arguments that can be specified through the config file, please have a look at the `test_config.sh` file provided in the MToolBox github repository (https://github.com/mitoNGS/MToolBox/blob/master/test_rCRS_config.sh). However, `mapExome.py` and `assemblyMTgenome.py` options can be still changed within the MToolBox command line, using the `-m` and `-a` option, respectively.

###CHANGELOG - 21 September 2015

###CHANGELOG - 8 June 2015

Update to MToolBox version 0.3.1 with the following change:

- A bug in the MToolBox.sh script has been fixed. Empty paired-end fastq files generated during SAM/BAM to fastq conversion are now removed.

###CHANGELOG - 28 February 2015

Update to MToolBox version 0.3 with the following new options and changes:

 - fastq.gz is a further possible input format file. Installation of zlib libraries is therefore required. 
 - users can specify the path of the working directories using ```–p``` (path to input folder) and ```–o``` (path to output folder) options.
 - users can specify a list of files to be used as input through -l option. It accepts a text file containing one sample name for each line. This list should be named as "list.txt" and placed in the input folder. Alternatively, users can provide comma-separated names with the same option. It is mandatory to report in such list the filename extension (e.g. mysample.sam or mysample.R1.fastq).
 - users can use -X option to allow the extraction from a BAM file of mitochondrial reads mapped onto a mitochondrial reference sequence. This option can be useful when using Whole Genome or Exome sequencing BAM files containing a huge amount ofnuclear reads. The option works only with the BAM format.

new fields added to the annotation.csv output file:
 - Disease Score: "% Disease", "% Neutral" and "% Unclassified" fields have been replaced with an overall Disease Score, generated as a weighted average of pathogenicity prediction scores for non-synonymous variants, derived from a training dataset of 53 non synonymous variants selected among mitochondrial diseases or cancer associated mutations. Weights have been calculated by taking into account the right prediction and the best probability to predict a truly pathogenic mtDNA variants generated by the pathogenicity prediction algorithms currently implemented in MToolBox.
 - MutPred Pred: MutPred prediction (Low pathogenicity, High pathogenicity).
 - dbSNP ID: Variant ID in dbSNP.

for users convenience, new scripts to help the generation of reports about the annotated and prioritized variants have been added to the suite of tools provided by MToolBox:
 - prioritization.py, which generates the prioritized_variants.txt file, reporting annotation only for prioritized variants for each sample analyzed, defined as variants recognized by the three reference sequences (rCRS, RSRS and MHCS), sorted per increasing variability.
 - summary.py, which generates the summary.txt file, reporting statistics about the coverage of reconstructed mitochondrial genomes, number of homoplasmic and heteroplasmic variants (for NGS data), haplogroup prediction and number of prioritized variants.

###CHANGELOG - 25 February 2015

 - An error occurred during the generation of circularized mitochondrial chromosome, used for the gsnap db generation. Hg19RCRS/hg19RSRS and chrRCRS/chrRSRS gsnap indexed databases have been replaced with those using the linearized mitochondrial chromosome. We apologize with the MToolBox users for this inconvenient. 

###CHANGELOG - 23 January 2015

Update to MToolBox version 0.2.2:

 - an error encountered during the analysis of hard clipping mapped reads has been fixed in the mtVariantCaller.py
 - the mtVariantCaller.py has been improved to better manage sites with multiple alleles.
 - hidden files included in the package and generating problems with the mt-classifier.py have been eliminated.

###CHANGELOG - 6 November 2014

Update to MToolBox version 0.2.1:

 - an error encountered during the sam to fastq extraction has been fixed in the MToolBox.sh file.
 - RCRS, hg19RCRS, RSRS and hg19RSRS gmap indexed databases have been regenerated using the -c option for circularized chromosomes.
 - update to Phylotree Build 16 for haplogroup prediction. 

###CHANGELOG - 29 September 2014

- an error fixed in the -t parameter of assembleMTgenome.

###CHANGELOG - 19 July 2014

- an error encountered during the bam to fastq extraction has been fixed. Empty unpaired fastq files are now removed.  

###CHANGELOG - 5 June 2014

- changed the method for estimation of the heteroplasmy confidence interval (CI). For sites with coverage depth <= 40, the heteroplasmy CI is estimated with the Wilson score interval; for larger coverage depth values, the Agresti-Coull interval is used.
- added the possibility to use fasta inputs to perform haplogroup prediction and functional annotation.
- added the possibility to use the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) as reference sequence for read mapping. By using rCRS as reference sequence, the VCF output will be rCRS-based.
